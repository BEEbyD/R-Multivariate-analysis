MULTIVARIATE STATISTICS
INTRODUCTION.
In this assignment, you will be working with a large dataset containing the details of patients screened for a thyroid condition. The dataset is saved as excel file. For each patient the dataset includes: age, sex , the system by which they were referred for testing, the results of four blood tests and the result of an indicator test. You can assume that multivariate normality holds for the quantitative observations in this dataset.
The main aim of the assignment is to use the  ‘R’ programing skills you have learnt in this module to analyse this dataset in details and answer the questions below, with written explanations where necessary.
QUESTIONS:
1.	Give an introduction describing the dataset being analysed, with brief explanations of the different columns of the data.
2.	 
I.	Create a new column separating the data into four age groups, ( ’35 and under’ ,  ’36 to 50’ , ’51 to 65’,  ’66 and over’ ) What are the proportions of indicator status  ‘P’ and ‘N’  in each group?
II.	Determine the overall sample mean vector containing four variables corresponding to the four quantitative variables ( i.e.  the four blood test results).
III.	Which of the four quantitative variables exhibits the greatest level of variation around the mean?
IV.	Which two quantitative variables, out of the four, shows the highest correlation and what type of correlation do they have?
3.	   I.          Test if the population mean vector of the four quantitative variables is equal to:
                              
                                population mean     µ = (5,2,110,110)

   II.	Provide a two-sample profile analysis plot of the sample means for the four    quantitative variables split into two groups (male and female), and test if the two profile are parallel.

4.	    
I.	Conduct a One-way MANOVA test to conclude if there is a significant difference in the four quantitative variables between the four age groups given in Q2(i) above. Clearly state the null hypothesis.
II.	Conduct individual ANOVA tests  on each of the variables independently and comment on your findings in relation to the MANOVA test. Comment on two main problems when taking this approach to assess to variables individually.
III.	If the null hypothesis was rejected in Q4(i) above, use discriminant analysis to determine which of the variables contributed most to the rejection.
        
5.	Conduct a two-way MANOVA test with age group as the first factor and sex as the second factor. Clearly state the null hypothesis. Comment on the result of your findings.
6.	Finally, write a conclusion of the main findings from your multivariate analysis. Summarise the results of your tests, discuss any problems or constraints that you encountered, and suggest possible next steps or additional analysis to improve your understanding of the data.
